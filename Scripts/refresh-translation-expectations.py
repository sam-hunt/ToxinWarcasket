# Toxin Warcasket's config shim over the shared sidecar-refresh engine
# (l10n/refresh/refresh_expectations.py, the rimworld-l10n submodule),
# which drives the L10nProbe dev mod (source at l10n/probe/; build/deploy it
# only from the canonical ~/dev/rimworld-l10n checkout). The engine holds all
# logic; this file holds only this repo's config and the rationale behind it.
# Usage is unchanged (game must be closed):
#   python3 Scripts/refresh-translation-expectations.py [--no-launch]
# If l10n/ is empty, run: git submodule update --init

# RATIONALE: VFE Pirates is the hard dependency (our defs parent on its
# abstract warcasket bases and would not resolve without it); Vanilla
# Expanded Framework and Harmony are VFEP's own hard deps and load before
# it. Biotech is the only DLC pinned: no DLC is hard-required, but Biotech
# is the planned compat gate (see the checker shim's REQUIRED_DLCS note),
# so the sidecar is generated with it from day one. Ideology is NOT pinned
# even though a stat leaf carries MayRequire for it: a gated leaf changes
# a number, never a def or a key. No family sibling rides along; this
# repo's list is its own. See the engine's header for the membership rule,
# the lowercase-id warning, and the pinning rationale; order is load
# order, the probe last.
#
# Plain ids on purpose: when the Workshop copy of a mod and a local Mods/
# copy coexist, RimWorld suffixes the Workshop one "_steam" and the plain id
# names the local copy. The plain id therefore resolves to whichever single
# copy is installed and never breaks when one of them is removed.
