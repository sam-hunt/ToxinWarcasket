# Pre-release integration smoke test: boots the real game once with Toxin
# Warcasket, its dependency chain and the one optional mod it patches for,
# on a pinned minimal list where the baseline is a clean log, then
# classifies every logged error/warning by origin and fails on anything
# attributed to this mod or an integration seam. Thin shim over the shared
# engine in l10n/smoke/startup_smoke.py (see its header for mechanics and the
# BetterTradersGuild v1.1.0 CWTL incident this exists to catch).
#
# Run this before every release, with the game closed:
#   python3 Scripts/integration-smoke-test.py              # boot + scan
#   python3 Scripts/integration-smoke-test.py --no-launch  # rescan last log
#   python3 Scripts/integration-smoke-test.py --strict     # any error fails

# RATIONALE: the first five entries are the l10n CANONICAL_ACTIVE_MODS (the
# refresh shim explains them: VFE Pirates is the hard dep, VEF and Harmony
# are its deps, Biotech is the other hard dep). Save Our Ship 2 is the
# only optional mod this repo integrates with: 1.6/Patches/SOS2Patch.xml
# fires on its display name (or Universum's) and never runs otherwise, and
# a failed PatchOperation is exactly the kind of error only a boot with the
# mod active can surface. SOS2 hard-requires Vehicle Framework, which is
# here only for that reason. Universum is not installed locally, and the
# patch is the same either way. Probe last (auto-quit). Plain ids on
# purpose; see the refresh shim's "_steam" note.
